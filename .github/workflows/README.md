# My First GitHub Action 

This repository is created to learn and practice **GitHub Actions**.  

It contains a simple workflow that runs automatically whenever code is **pushed** to the repository. The workflow is designed to:  

- Checkout the repository code  
- Set up multiple versions of Python (3.8 and 3.9)  
- Install dependencies (from `requirements.txt`, if available)  
- Run tests using **pytest**
